## 🔧 tools and 🧠 thoughts on tools

**react**

still my preferred framework, it feels the closest to "just javascript". Other frameworks abstract more than than I'm comfortable with.

**vite**

a new one, but I can't imagine going back to webpack after trying it once

**tailwind**

had to try it once to see what the hype was about, probably wouldn't use it again in a such a small project. Although I do think it has potential for building design systems. Seems like it would be a good fit for bigger projects, but I'll likely stick with scss in the future 🤷‍♂️.

**react-three-fiber**

still the most ergonomic webgl library I've used, 10/10 would reccomend. Also brought in @react-three/drei for the first time, which I'm eager to explore more.
