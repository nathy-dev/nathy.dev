## 🔧 tools and 🧠 thoughts on tools

**react**

Still my preferred framework, it feels the closest to "just javascript". Other frameworks abstract more than than I'm comfortable with.

**vite**

A new one, but I can't imagine going back to webpack after trying it once.

**tailwind**

Had to try it once to see what the hype was about. I think it has potential for building design systems and seems like it would be a good fit for bigger projects, but I kind of hate the syntax and prefer style solutions that are a bit closer to plain css. I'll continue to use it for a couple more projects to see if I get over the initial shock factor, but I'll likely stick with more like "traditional" css preprocessors (e.g. scss) 🤷‍♂️.

**react-three-fiber**

The most ergonomic (and only lol) webgl library I've used, 10/10 would reccomend. Also brought in @react-three/drei for the first time, which I'm eager to explore more.
